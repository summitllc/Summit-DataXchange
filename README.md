# Summit-DataXchange
Welcome to Summit's data science Community of Practice (CoP)! This space is where Summit teammates come together to share knowledge, exchange tools and techniques, collaborate on projects, and support each other’s growth as data professionals. Whether you’re exploring a new package, contributing best practices, or showcasing a cool visualization, DataXchange is here to help us learn and build together.

## Rules
- The data for each assignment can be found in the [Data](Data/) folder.
- Each assignment is organized within the [Assignment](Assignments/) folder.
- Assignments are **optional** and designed to be quick & done on your own time.
- Time spent in the CoP meeting should be charged to `ADMIN OH`.
